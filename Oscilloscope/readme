Designed a custom R-2R ladder(DAC) and filter circuits 
Coupled them with the Arduino Uno to produce custom images on Oscilloscope
Implemented the same on TM4c123G ARM Cortex M-4 processor
Wrote a python script to convert any given input image to a set of points that can be easily interfaced with oscilloscope
Created images such as circle and rectangle using different combination of Sine and Cosine waves
Other complex waveforms can be created depending on the requirement such as ramp, starbust, etc
